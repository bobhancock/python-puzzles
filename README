The example section of each problem is shows expected input and output..  The solution output section, if it exists, is the actual answer for the provided data.

Description of File Data
Each problem will have a text file that provides the input.  The file naming convention is level_problemnumber.txt.

Fields are separated by pipe symbols.  Strings are delimited by quotes it is a string.  If it is delimited by parentheses, it is a tuple.
Delimited by brackets it is a list.  Delimited by braces, it is a dictionary.

Example:
1,2,[“bob”, “peter”], (“bob”, “peter”), 32.093

This record consists of:
integer, integer, list of strings, tuple of strings, float

The file names are level_problemnumber.data.  The file for the the first problem in level 1 is 1_1.data.

Level 1
Problem 1
Write a procedure to determine if the members in a record are distinct/unique.  Read each record in the file and print the record number and True or False to standard out.
Input
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fovxy9sumq4v4ri/kgax6zkZeu/1_1.data

Example
Input
a|b|c
g|h|g
Output
1 True 
2 False

Solution Output
1 True
2 False
3 False
4 True
5 False


Problem 2
Given a sequence of stock prices in a record,  pick the best best time to buy and then sell.  Each record in the file represents a different stock.  Calculate the profit for each stock and then the total profit.  If it is not possible to make a profit, minimize the loss.
Input
The first line of input gives the number of stocks you can use, N. For each stock, the record consists of a series of numbers representing prices throughout the day.  Note, that the number of price quotes per stock can vary.

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fovxy9sumq4v4ri/A4FJpJGNER/1_2.data
Output
For each stock output: buy_price sell_price profit separated by spaces on a separate line.
The last last output line: TOTAL PROFIT = total_profit

2 3 1
99 102 3
110 109 -1   
TOTAL PROFIT = 3
Solution Output
Input   Output
2
3,4,1,6,2       1 6 5
200,200,198,199.5,199.98,199.72,199.71  198 199.98 1.98
3,6,9,1,6,8.32  1 8.32 7.32
TOTAL PROFIT: 14.3



Problem 3

Example
Input 
64
99

Output
1 True
2 False
Solution Output
1 True
2 True
3 False

5 False

Problem 4
Rotate the string “abcdefghi” four characters to the left.
Solution Output
efghiabcd

Problem 5
Write a procedure to print to stdout a listing of all the operations, including double underscore operations, that can be used with a list but not a tuple.  For example, pop can be used with a list but not with a tuple.

Problem 6
Find the largest prime factor of (maximum integer allowed by Python / 1000).

Example
If the input were 21, the output would be 7.
Problem 7
Write a procedure that returns True or False that tells you if a record begins with the name of the day of the week.  Do this without using if:else.

Input 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fovxy9sumq4v4ri/4B92mWrCY5/1_7.data
Example
Input
I hate Mondays.
Saturday is my favorite day.
Output
1 False
2 True
Solution Output
1 True
2 False
3 False
4 True
5 False




Problem 8
Given an integer, find the next largest integer that uses the same digits.

Example

If the number is 15432, you should return 21345.




Problem 9
In a sequence, insert a sub-sequence.  Given the input below, insert the numbers between 20 and 40 so that it looks like the output.  Do this without using iteration

Input
 [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
 Output
 [0, 10, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
 
 Problem 10
 Given a set of words, find all all the anagrams for each word.

 Input
 tulsa
 stop
 dictionary
 intoxicate
 listen
 beta

 Output
 original_word anagram1 anagram2 …

 alert alter later


 
 Problem 11
 Write a procedure to reverse the words in each record; do this is one line of code.  Print the results to stdout separated by spaces.

 Input
 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fovxy9sumq4v4ri/Dc16zF-SKO/1_11.data

 Example
 Input
 Bob,Peter,Igor,Guido,Joachim

 Output
 Joachim Guido Igor Peter Bob


 

 Problem 12
 From a file of unsorted integers, retrieve the three smallest integers without using sort().

 Input
 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fovxy9sumq4v4ri/WYvnwIZhi0/1_13.data

 Output
 Three smallest integers.

 Solution Output
 100 101 103
 Problem 13
 Write a procedure that returns True or False that tells you if the last word of text in a record is a member of tuple of words.  For this problem used days of the week as the end words.  Do this without using if:else.

 Input 
 1_13.data

 end_words = ("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
        "Thursday", "Friday")

        Example
        Input
        I hate Mondays
        Saturday is my favorite day
        Output
        1 True
        2 False
        Solution Output

        2 False
        3 False
        4 True
        5 False

 Problem 14
Write a procedure that returns True or False to verify whether a string represents a valid rational number limited to decimal representation.  

        Example
        3.14 True
        ⅛ False
        two False
        3.5E9 True




Problem 15
Given a list of integers, write a procedure to print each number to stdout, starting at index 0, until you encounter the first odd number.  Do this without referencing the list directly in a for loop.  e.g.

        for i in my_list:
                if it is even print_it
                 else stop
